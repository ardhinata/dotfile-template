# Dotfiles template
This is a template repository for managing dotfile with [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) with some additional helper script.

## Background
This template repository created because [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) don't have functionality to securing sensitive configuration, and there's this [article](https://abdullah.today/encrypted-dotfiles/) ([snapshot if article gets removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20200307194245/https://abdullah.today/encrypted-dotfiles/)). This is similar to [Dotbot template](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles_template), but with helper script `dotfile-secret` added to template.

## License
The helper script is released under public domain. Refer to `LICENSE.md` for details.
